<h1 align='center'>DONATE FOR HAPPIER CHILDHOODS</H1><br><br>
<P>
<h2>WHY DONATE?</h2>
India’s future depends on its children. Their future depends on YOU.

Children are the building blocks of our country. All children must have access to quality education, nutrition, and a secure environment to reach their full potential. Therefore, we at CRY aspire to keep helping children in pursuing their aspirations and providing them with the childhoods they truly deserve.

Thanks to the incredible support and kindness of generous donors like you, we’ve achieved a remarkable milestone of impacting 1.3 million children! From helping 30,000 children return to school to raising awareness against period shame, and making STEM education accessible, we’ve accomplished so much together in the last year! With your continued support, we hope to reach a million more children this year!

Every contribution you make helps us ensure that India’s children can go to school, get proper nutrition and healthcare and stay protected from abuse and exploitation.

We cannot do the work that we do without your support. Continue supporting us in our mission of creating happier childhoods for India’s children.
